Some classes in the IHE-RO-Testtool project need to be serialized and deserialized from and to XML. These classes are autogenerated from an XML SChema Definition file (XSD), by running a bat file. When code changes are needed to the generated classes, you can easily make these changes by changing the XSD file and generating the new code from it. 

Here's how to do it:

1 - Make the appropprate changes to the XML file, for example "Testtoolconfiguration.Xml";
2 - Use Altova XML Spy or another XML tool to generate the schema file for you. You can also make the changes to the XSD file (for example "Testtoolconfig.XSD") directly if you don't have a convient tool.
Make sure you validate your xml file against your schema.
3 - Generate the VB class (for example "TesttoolConfig.vb") by running the accompaying bat file (for example "GenerateConfigClassesVB.bat"). (It calls XSD.exe, a utility tool to generate schema or class files from given source, or vice versa. It should be installed with the .NET Framework tools as part of the .NET Framework SDK.)
4 - Rename the VB file to VBC ("TesttoolConfig.vb" to "TesttoolConfig.vbc")
5 - Edit the VBC file ("TesttoolConfig.vbc"): surround the used "imports" section in a block with compiler directive "#If Not DVT_INTERPRETS_SCRIPT" and remove the "Options" section, like so:

#If Not DVT_INTERPRETS_SCRIPT Then

<delete this:> Option Strict Off
<delete this:> Option Explicit On

Imports System.Xml.Serialization

#End If

6 - Done. You can now use the new code.
